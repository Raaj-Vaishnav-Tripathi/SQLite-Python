**## SQLite File Explorer**

This Python project provides a simple tool to explore the basic structure and information of SQLite database files. It's a great way to get started with interacting with databases using Python!

**What is SQLite?**

SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained database engine commonly used for storing data in mobile apps and other situations where a simple and compact solution is needed.

**What can this project do?**

- **Verify file validity:** Ensures you're working with a valid SQLite database (version 3 format).
- **Retrieve basic database information:** Provides details like database page size, giving insight into data storage within the file. 

**Who is this project for?**

- **Python Beginners:** This project helps you practice working with files and basic database concepts using Python.
- **SQLite Developers:** This tool is useful for quickly checking the structure and validity of SQLite files.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 and `pipenv` installed. `pipenv` is a virtual environment management tool for Python.

2. **Download Project Files:** Clone this repository or download the project files directly.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then, run:

   ```
   pip install pipenv
   ```

   This installs the necessary Python libraries for the project to function.

**Using the Project**

Once the dependencies are installed, use the project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 -m app.sqlite_explorer "my_database.db" ".dbinfo" --config "settings.yaml"
```

Here's a breakdown of the command arguments:

- `<sqlite_file>`: Path to the target SQLite database file.
- `<command>`: Currently supports only `.dbinfo`, which provides basic database information.
- `[ --config <config_file> ]` (Optional): Path to the configuration file (`project_config.yml`) for potential customization (not covered in this basic usage).

**Example:**

Assuming you have an SQLite database file named `sample.db` in your project directory, run the following command to get basic information about the database:

```
python3 -m app.sqlite_explorer "sample.db" ".dbinfo"
```

This will output information like the database page size.
